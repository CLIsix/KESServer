# KES Server
The source code for the current Key Exchange Swarm Bot.

Note: _Running this server locally is useless at the moment_.

## Running the Server:
1. Clone this repo
2. [Create a new telegram bot](https://t.me/botfather).
3. Create a file in the root of the project named ```API_KEYS``` with the following content:
   
   ```
   Your Botfather API KEY
   ```
5. Run ```server.bat``` or ```server.sh```, depending on your operating system.
